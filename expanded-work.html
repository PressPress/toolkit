            This section includes the workshop plan Press Press used to facilitate two workshops in January 2019 at the George Peabody Library in Baltimore, Maryland. The conversations that occured within these two workshops are the basis of this toolkit and inspired directions for further research. A sample workshop plan is included below for your reference. We invite you to build on our work by hosting a version of this workshop with your collaborators, peers, and community.

            <br><br>
            In this small gathering, Press Press invites individuals involved in cooperative, collective, or collaborative work to exchange expertise, experiences, and advice on cooperative processes. Through conversation and group brainstorming, we will collaboratively create a toolkit for cooperative, collaborative, and collective work. We invite you to participate in a small gathering where we can exchange our experiences with cooperative work and workshop through the challenges we have faced.

            Let everyone get a sense of who else is in the room, especially if they don’t already know each other. We like making this part fun by asking folks to answer a goofy question, like: <span class="italic">What fruit or vegetable best describes you today? </span>And a more serious question, like: <span class="italic">What cooperative, collective, or collaborative project(s) are you involved with or have been involved with in the past?

            Facilitate a shared agreements process by asking folks what they expect and need of one another in order to be able to have an honest, open, and courageous conversation. Make a distinction between a courageous and safe space. You can suggest or bring forward some of your own agreements as an example if folks struggle to come up with them at first.

            Before delving into the details of our challenges, we want to briefly discuss why we do this work in the first place. <span class="italic"> Why do we care to sustain cooperative, collective, or collaborative working structures? What are examples of meaningful cooperation or collaborations you have been part of in Baltimore? Why did these experiences leave an impact on you?

What issues are you still working through?</span>
            <br><br>
            If folks have a hard time starting, you can share a few of your own reasons. For example:

            Write down any challenges you face within cooperative work that you want to bring to the group on small sheets of paper. Then, write out the tool(s) you have to offer regarding cooperative work on a different color paper. After giving folks some time to reflect, pass around a box where all of the challenges can be placed inside anonymously. Later, when these are shared, participants can choose to say if they belong to them or not.

          As we pull out challenges from the box, ask the group if anyone’s tools can solve or add insight to the challenges shared. As folks share, write out the challenges and tools on the board using the note-taking technique outlined above.

As written in its introduction, the guide “details specific ways in which disabled people are excluded from cultural spaces and offers possible solutions to those barriers. Moving away from historical and juridical definitions of accessibility, this guide considers the unique capacity of small scale arts organizations to meet the needs of disabled communities. It engages principles of disability justice to think through what can urgently be done to create more equitable and accessible arts spaces.”

They are damaging because they promote white supremacy thinking. They are damaging to both people of color and to white people. Organizations that are people of color-led or a majority people of color can also demonstrate many damaging characteristics of white supremacy culture.”
